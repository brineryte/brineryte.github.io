<div style="text-align:center;">
I am a Christian, a husband, a dad, a software engineer, and sometimes, a "musician". I started this blog to give myself an outlet for my thoughts and ramblings since I don't really use social media. I enjoy spending time with my wonderful family, reading, and occasionally writing and recording music. Below you'll find some samples of that.
