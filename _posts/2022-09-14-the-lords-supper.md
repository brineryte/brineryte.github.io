This is my cliff-notes version of a short book by Thomas Watson from the 17th century focusing on The Sacrament of the Eucharist. I found it very refreshing and it deepened my love, appreciation, and desire for Christ and his Supper. Pick it up [on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Supper-Puritan-Paperbacks/dp/0851518540).

1. But I find such a faintness and feebleness in my soul
    - Then you have even more need to go. Our weakness should send us to Christ
1. But I have often come and find no fruit,I am not filled with comfort
   - Though he may not fill you with comfort He may fill you with Strength
   - If you are not filled with joy, but your eyes with tears, this is God meeting you at His table
   - If your comforts are low, yet your faith is high, this is God's manifesting His presence in the Supper
