This is my cliff-notes version of a short book by Thomas Watson from the 17th century focusing on The Sacrament of the Eucharist. I found it very refreshing and it deepend my love, appreciation, and desire for Christ and his Supper.

## The Mystery of The Lord's Supper
### A visible sermon
- Q: Why was the sacrament appointed?
- A: As a visible sign.

## Five Particulars
1. #### The Author: Jesus
1. #### The Time: After supper and Before His sufferings
1. #### The Manner  
    - The taking of the bread
        - Christ is set apart for us
        - We must be set apart for him
        - Why bread? 
            - Type: Showbread, Symbol: "I am the Bread of Life"
            - Bread is useful, satisfying and strengthening.
    - The blessing of it
        - Common bread was changed into a holy use, Consecration
        - Opened the nature of the sacraments to the Apostles
            - Corporeal reception of the elements = Spiritual reception of Christ Himself
        - Signified His prayer for a blessing upon the Ordinance
            - To Sanctify the elect
        - The blessing was His giving thanks (Eucharistia)
            - For God giving His Son
            - For the elements as signs and seals of our redemption
    - The breaking of it
        - Foreshadowed His death and passion
        - Why was His body broken?
            - Not for himself
            - For our sins
        - How could He suffer?
            - Only in His human nature
        - How then could this satisfy for our sin?
            - Hypostatical union
            - He was Sacrifice, Priest and Altar (Matt 23:19)
                - The Altar of His divine nature sanctified the sacrifice of His death
        - 2 Observations regarding His sufferings
            1. It was bitter to Him
                - It was a lingering death
                - It was a painful death
                - It was a shameful death
                - It was a cursed death
            2. It is sweet to us
                - Christ has overcome sin, death, and Satan

    - The Administering of the cup
        - The Lord gives redemption in abundance (Ps. 130)
        - What is meant by His taking th cup?
            - The spilling of His blood
1. #### The Guests
    - Given to the disciples, true belivers
    - No benefit to non-believers
1. #### The Benefits
    - The Remission of Sins
    - Refutation of Transubstantiation
        1. It is absurd
            - It is contrary to scripture (Acts 3:21)
            - It is contrary to reason
        2. It is impious
            - It is a profaning of Christ's body
            - It runs men inevitably upon sin
        - It is to be abhorred
        - Implies the Supper is not efficacious
    - The supper gives us a taste of Christ

    - To reject the supper is to reject Christ

## Christ's Love Displayed in the Sacrament
1. Behold the love of God in giving His Son
1. Behold the wonderful love of Christ
    - He who knew no sin was reputed a sinner
    - He suffered death
    - He died freely

    - He is interceding for us (Heb 9:24)

## The Broken Body of Christ
- Was Christ's Body Broken?
    - Then we should hate the sin for which he was put to death
    - We should not marvel at our own sufferings
    - We should be affected with the great goodness of Christ
    - We should highly value Him
    - Christ's flesh exceeds Manna
        - Manna was food, but not medicine
        - Manna was corruptible
