Hello, <span class="red">and</span> welcome to my blog. M<span class="red">y</span> name is Brine Ryte. I've been a web developer and s<span class="red">o</span>ftware engineer for almost a decade and have had the opport<span class="red">u</span>nity to work with many wonderful languages, frameworks, and libraries. I have also <span class="red">w</span>orn many hats from front and back end dev to qa and devops. My goal for th<span class="red">i</span>s b<span class="red">l</span>og is to share some of the knowledge I've picked up over the years in the tech space.

I've also been writing my own music since I was in the 8th grade. I've been a part of some cool projects a<span class="red">l</span>ong they way. Another goal for this blog is to discuss the music I love and share with you some of the things I'm working on.

One last thing about me is that I can never commit to one topic, <span class="red">s</span>o aside from the above, you can't really <span class="red">e</span>xpect what I'm going to post about. I'd like to share some of my fiction, lyrics, and po<span class="red">e</span>try. I may share my thoughts and opinions. 

Look closely<span class="keyhole">.</span>

Brine
